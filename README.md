# Welcome to WebDevProject! 
Thank you for visiting our full-stack web development project page! We are building an e-commerce website that sells shoes to customers.

## <ins> Tech Stack </ins>
We are using Vue.js, Laravel (PHP) and Tailwind CSS. This is a modified version of the more popular VILT tack (Vue.js, Inertia, Laravel, Tailwind CSS). Instead of Inertia, our team is using RESTful APIs to decouple the frontend and the backend.

## <ins> Use of GitHub by Team 1 </ins>
 * Each team member works on their own <ins>***individual branch</ins> - please see individual branches for a more detailed list of contributions by each member***.

 * Moreover, there is a develoment branch, where features from different team members are combined and added.

 * Additionally, there is a main branch, to which working versions of the website are merged/ pushed from the development branch at regular intervals.

## <ins> Contents </ins>
This repository contains the following:
 * Code from both the back-end and front-end parts of the website.
   
 * A file to document any dependencies: _Dependencies.txt_.
   
 * A folder for database schema diagrams, and code that may be used to render these diagrams on dbdiagram.io.
